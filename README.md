## Hey!

How's it going?

### So, you're trying to choose a language...

#### You'll know when you need JavaScript.
* And, if you can get away with [TypeScript](https://www.typescript-lang.org/index.html), you should.
* [Haxe](https://haxe.org) is also a good choice.

#### You'll also know when you need Lisp.

#### Choose [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) if:
* ...you want to make cross-platform tools.
* ...you need to run a tight, one dev operation.
* ...you don't mind learning a bit about your target and monkey-patching a few things.

#### Choose [Raku](https://raku.org) if:
* ...you need to parse text.
* ...you want a nice CLI tool to use every now-and-then.
* ...startup time and performance are less of an priority.

#### Choose [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) if:
* ...you need speed and safety.
* ...you don't mind longer compile times.
* ...you don't mind "the Rust way or the highway".
