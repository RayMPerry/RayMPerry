## Hey!

How's it going?

### So, you're trying to choose a language...

#### You'll know when you need JavaScript.
* And, if you can get away with [TypeScript](https://www.typescript-lang.org/index.html), you should.

#### You'll also know when you need Lisp.

#### Choose [Haxe](https://haxe.org) if:
* ...you want to make cross-platform tools.
* ...you need to run a tight, one dev operation.
* ...you don't mind learning a bit about your target and monkey-patching a few things.

#### Choose [Raku](https://raku.org) if:
* ...you need to parse text.
* ...you want a nice CLI tool to use every now-and-then.
* ...startup time and performance are less of an priority.

#### Choose [D](https://dlang.org) if:
* ...performance needs to be better than Raku.
* ...you need a "script" that can scale out to be a larger project.
* ...you don't mind tweaking a stop-the-world garbage collector.

##### NOTE: D and Raku are two sides of the same coin and share many similarities.

#### Choose [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) if:
* ...you need speed and safety.
* ...you don't mind longer compile times.
* ...you don't mind "the Rust way or the highway".
