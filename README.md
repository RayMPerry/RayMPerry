## Hey!

How's it going?

### So, you're trying to choose a language...

#### You'll know when you need JavaScript.
* And, if you can get away with [TypeScript](https://www.typescript-lang.org/index.html), you should.
* [Haxe](https://haxe.org) is also a good choice.
* [Nim](https://nim-lang.org) can transpile to JavaScript as well.

#### You'll also know when you need Lisp.

#### Choose [D](https://dlang.org) if:
* ...you want to make cross-platform tools.
* ...you need a better-by-degrees C++ with a gentle learning curve.
* ...[Raku](https://raku.org) hasn't gotten its speed-up yet.
* ...you don't mind tweaking a stop-the-world GC.

#### Choose [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) if:
* ...you need speed and safety.
* ...you don't mind longer compile times.
* ...you don't mind "the Rust way or the highway".
